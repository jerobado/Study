# Embedded Signing
- Embedded signing (also called the envelope recipient view) enables users to view and sign documents directly through your app or website. To use embedded signing, your app must:
    - Generate signing URLs
    - Authenticate the envelope recipients
    - Present the signing request in the app UI
    - Redirect the user once the transaction is complete
    
- By embedding DocuSign functionality in your app, you can use its UI to initiate the signing process and enable your users to send or sign documents directly within your app, avoiding the need to switch contexts to email.

### Flow
1. Authenticate via Authorization Code Grant
