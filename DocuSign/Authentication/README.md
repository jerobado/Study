# Authentication

DocSign provides three scenarios for implementing OAuth:
- Authorization Code Grant
- Implicit Grant
- JWT Grant

### Authorization Code Grant
- if your users will log in to DocuSign
- if your app uses a browser or client to make requests of a web server, it has a browser/server architecture

### Implicit Grant
- if your app is a single-page application (SPA) or other browser-based application that sends API requests directly from a script running in a browser

### JWT Grant
- if you use a single login for all users in your app
