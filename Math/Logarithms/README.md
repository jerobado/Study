# Logarithms
A logarithm answer the question:
> How many of one number multiple together to make another number?

For example:
```
How many 2s multiple together to make 8?

Answer:
2 x 2 x 2 = 8, so we had to multiply 3 of the 2s to get 8

So the logarithm is 3.
```

Using Python:
```python
import math

# Get the log number of 8 with base 2
math.log(8, 2)
# 3.0

# Using math.pow() to get the original number 8
math.pow(2, 3.0)
# 8.0
```
