# Qt Installer Framework
- a set of tools and utilities to create installers for the supported desktop Qt platforms: Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS
- The Qt Installer Framework provides a set of tools and utilities to create installers once, and deploy them across all the supported desktop Qt platforms without rewriting the source code.
- The installers will have the native look and feel of the platform on which they run: Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS.
- The Qt Installer Framework tools generate installers with a set of pages that guide the users during the installation, update, or uninstall process. You supply the installable content and specify information about it, such as the name of the product and the installer and the text for the license agreement.
- You can customize the installers by adding widgets to the predefined pages or by adding whole pages to offer users more options. You can create scripts to add operations to the installer.
