# Go

# Setup and Installation
* Follow installation instruction [here](https://golang.org/doc/install)

# Code Style
* Use `tab` to indent
* Opening brace `{` must be on the same line as the declaration or command that begins the block. This is due to the _Semicolon Insertion Rule_
* Use the `go fmt <filename.go>` to format your code based on Go coding style
