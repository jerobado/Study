# Microservice
- Is an architectural pattern that organizes an application into a collection of loosely coupled, fine-grained services that communicate through lightweight protocols.
- A microservices architecture consists of a collection of small, autonomous services. Each service is self-contained and should implement a single business capability within a bounded context. A bounded context is a natural division within a business and provides an explicit boundary within which a domain model exists.

## Characteristics of Microservices

**Independent Deployment**
    
Each microservice can be deployed, updated, and scaled independently without affecting other services. 

**Loosely Coupled**

Services have minimal dependencies on each other, allowing for greater flexibility and easier maintenance. 

**Small, Focused Teams**

Microservices are often designed to be owned and maintained by small, cross-functional teams. 

**Well-Defined APIs**

Services communicate with each other through APIs, enabling modularity and interoperability.

**Business Capability Focused**

Each microservice typically implements a specific business capability or function.
