# Lessons Learned

Organize your songs in DJ sets that have the following:
- intro (warmp-up)
- build-up
- peak (climax)
- outro (cooldown)

Use Harmonic mixing to identify songs that complement each other when transitioning.

Don't forget to **key lock** when beatmatching.

You can slowly adjust the current song's BPM to its original BPM after beat matching.
