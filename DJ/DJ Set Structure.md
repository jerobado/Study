# DJ Set Structure

| Section      | Purpose / Vibe                        | Recommended BPM Range | Example Track Types |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Warm-up      | Set the mood, ease listeners in       | 90–110 BPM            | Chill hip-hop, downtempo house, R&B |
| Build-up     | Increase energy, get people moving    | 110–120 BPM           | Funky house, disco edits, mid-tempo EDM |
| Peak         | Main energy, dancefloor bangers       | 120–128 BPM           | House, EDM drops, pop remixes |
| Cool-down    | Smooth landing, close the vibe        | 80–95 BPM             | Chill tracks, lo-fi hip-hop, slower R&B |


### How to Use This
- **Warm-up**: Start with tracks that are easy to mix and not too intense.
- **Build-up**: Gradually raise BPM and energy — this is where you hook the crowd.
- **Peak**: Keep BPM steady around 120–128 BPM for maximum dance energy.
- **Cool-down**: Drop the tempo to relax the vibe and signal the end of the set.
