# Webhooks
- Webhooks provide a way for notifications to be delivered to an external web server whenever certain events occur on GitHub.
- Webhooks let you subscribe to events happening in a software system and automatically receive a delivery of data to your server whenever those events occur.
- Webhooks are used to receive data as it happens, as opposed to polling an API (calling an API intermittently) to see if data is available. With webhooks, you only need to express interest in an event once, when you create the webhook.
