Stored Procedures
---
A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements with an assinged name, which are "stored" in an RDBMS as a group, so it can be reused and shared by multiple programs.

A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.
