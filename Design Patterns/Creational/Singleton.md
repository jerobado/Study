# Singleton
- the intent of the singleton pattern is to ensure that a class only has one instance, and to provide a global point of access to it

### Use cases
- when there must be a exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point
- when the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code
