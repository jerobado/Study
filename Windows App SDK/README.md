# Windows App SDK
- is a set of developer components and tools that represent the next revolution in the Windows app development platform
- the Windows App SDK provides a unified set of APIs and tools that can be used in a consistent way by any desktop app on Windows 11 and downlevel to Windows 10, version 1809.
- the Windows App SDK doesn't replace the Windows SDK or existing desktop Windows app types such as .NET (including Windows Forms and WPF) and desktop Win32 with C++. Instead, the Windows App SDK complements those existing tools and app types with a common set of APIs that developers can rely on across these platforms.
