# Modern C++
- Modern C++ emphasizes the principle of resource acquisition is initialization (RAII).
- usage of three smart pointer types: `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr`
- By using std::string and std::wstring, you can eliminate virtually all the errors associated with C-style strings
- `std::vector` and other Standard Library containers
