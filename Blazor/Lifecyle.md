# Lifecyle
- The Razor component processes Razor component lifecycle events in a set of synchronous and asynchronous lifecycle methods.
- The lifecycle methods can be overridden to perform additional operations in components during component initialization and rendering.

### Events
`SetParametersAsync`

`OnInitialized{Async}`

`OnParametersSet{Async}`

`OnAfterRender{Aync}`
