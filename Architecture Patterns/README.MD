# Architecture Patterns


# Design patterns

**Repository pattern**
- an abstraction over the idea of persistent storage

**Service Layer**
- pattern to clearly define where our use cases begin and end

**Unit of Work pattern**
- to provide atomic operations

**Aggregate pattern**
- to enforce the integrity of our data


# Domain modeling

**domain**
- the problem you're trying to solve

**model**
- is a map of a process or phenomenon that captures a useful property

**value object**
- a business concept that has data but not identity
- is any domain object that is uniquely identified by the data it holds

**entity**
- a domain object that has long-lived identity
