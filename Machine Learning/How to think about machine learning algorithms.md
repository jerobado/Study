# How to think about machine learning algorithms

### Objectives
- spot applications of Machine Learning in the real world
- differentiate between the various types of Machine Learning problems
- pick the type of machine learning solution to solve that problem: classify, regress, recommend or cluster

### Machine Learning-based approached flow:
1. Collect a large amount of data
2. Use an algorithm to identify the relationship between the data and your expected outcome
3. Update this relationship continuously with new data

### Typical Machine Learning workflow:
1. Pick your problem. Identify which type of problem we need to solve.
2. Represent Data. Represent data using numeric attributes
3. Apply an algorithm. Use a standard algorithm to find a model

# When to use Machine Learning?
- When it is difficult for humans to express rules because the number of influencing variables involved and the difficulty to understand the relationships between these variables
- A large amount of historical data is available
- Patterns and relationships of these data are dynamic

# Types of ML problems

### Classification
- if you want to know the class of a certain data (spam or ham, girl or boy, etc.)
- when there is a need to classify the data in different classes

### Regression
- if you want to predict a specific value

### Clustering
- if you want to categorize the data into similar groupings/clusters

### Recommendations
- if you want to recommend something such as "next item" to buy, "next video" to watch or "next song" to listen

### Data Generation
- if you want to generate data such as images, videos, articles, posts, etc.
