## Terms

#### Feature extraction
- Transforming arbitrary data, such as text or images, into numerical features usable for machine learning.

## Problems

### Classification
- You want an algorithm to answer binary yes-or-no questions (cats or dogs, good or bad, sheep or goats, you get the idea) or you want to make a multiclass classification (grass, trees, or bushes; cats, dogs, or birds etc.) You also need the right answers labeled, so an algorithm can learn from them.
